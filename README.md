# tikzclip
My approach towards abstracting tikz clipart depicting different nationals and professions. 

The code for the figure is based on tikzpeople source code. The philosophy is to depict people by an abstract figure with a badge showing the tools of the profession.


The Alphabet folder contains pdf figures depicting english alphabets. They should be easier to use with Powerpoint or similar softwares. I included the sets in three colours. You can modify the script to generate more.

The basic folder contains the basic figure in more than 200 colours.
