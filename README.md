# tikzclip
My approach towards abstracting tikz clipart depicting different nationals and professions. 

The code for the figure is based on tikzpeople source code. The philosophy is to depict people by an abstract figure with a badge showing the tools of the profession.

I have now created pdf figures depicting english alphabets. They should be easier to use with Powerpoint or similar softwares.
